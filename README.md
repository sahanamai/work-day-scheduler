# work-day-scheduler
* This is an assignment about work day scheduler, created with html,css moment.js and javascript(jquery).
* I used moment.js() to show the current month and day in the header.
* The calender is updated every second to insure the data is correct and that each time blocks is lined up with the clock. And each time block correlates to what time it is.
* The timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
* When you enter a event in the block and click save, the text is saved in the local storage. If the page is refreshed the text is retrieved and remains in the box.
